DogecoinDark PaperWallet version 2!  11/14/2014

This project is a fork of bitaddress.org, the original trustworthy
JavaScript powered offline bitcoin address generator. 

This attractive paper wallet design is two-sided and folds up to
hide the private key. 

This generator includes the same pseudorandom key generation as bitaddress.org, as
well as support for creating wallets using "vanity keys", passphrases ("brain wallets")
or even rolling dice or shuffling cards.

This generator also includes support and designs for making
DogecoinDark classic or alternate graphic "remix" paper wallets.

the zipfile including the necessary graphics can be found on our website:
